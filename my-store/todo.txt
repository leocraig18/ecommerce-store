    - Should refactor to execute the file upload when update product is triggered and wait for upload to execute PUT request on product.

- Add a guest checkout feature so login isnt required.
    - Consider storing information anyway incase they sign up in future to see previous orders attached to their email.
    -  Require users to select guest or login checkout before going to shipping page.
